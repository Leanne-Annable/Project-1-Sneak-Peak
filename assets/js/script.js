/* Create an API call on page load to search for movies released within the last 2 months
    using the "released" or "Year" key from the OMDB info.
    Will probably need to use moment.js to set a time scale? 
    Or we could find another type of movies to link to the page - Maybe "classics" instead of recent releases
    if the code becomes too challenging within our timescale


/* create an API to call information from OMDB containing 
    -   The Movie Title
    -   Age Rating
    -   Movie Length
    -   The Plot
    -   The Main Actors
    -   The Release date
    -   Genre
    -   The IMDB Rating
    -   The movie poster


    Will need the API search to be given by either the inputted text, or the clicked image


/* create an API to YouTube to get the movie trailer 
    (This again will need to be linked to either the inputted text or clicked image)

    in the call code we will need to add "movie trailer" so the youtube search looks for that specifically
